# tps-reporter

> Task progress sheet reporter

Use this to estimate how far a project is done, and help schedule the rest of the work.

## Usage

```sh
npm install -g rstacruz/tps-reporter.js    # via npm
yarn global add rstacruz/tps-reporter.js   # via yarnpkg.com
```

Usage:

```sh
tps-report --help

tps-report project.tasks --open   # open in browser
tps-report project.tasks          # show in CLI
```

## How it works

Create a project file `project.tasks`. See [Format documentation](docs/format.md) for details.

    This file is in TaskPaper format.
    Tabs are used to indent.
    Each task begins with a "- ".
    Projects end with a ":".
    Tags are in the format "@tag_name".
    All other lines (such as these) are considered as notes,
    and are to be ignored.
